<div class="para">As described above, it is generally regarded as safe to use the Poisson as a means of approximating binomial probabilities when <span class="process-math">\(n \ge
20\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\theta \le 0.05\)</span> or if <span class="process-math">\(n \gt 100\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\theta
\lt 0.10\text{.}\)</span>  In some cases the approximation will work quite well even in violation of these bounds. Approximation may be slightly less important in modern times than it was in the past due to the ubiquity of computers and software, though the connection is still worth remembering.</div>
