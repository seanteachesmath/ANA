<p>
	Consider the function <m>f(x) = e^x</m> at a point
<m>x_0=1</m> and approximations to its derivative <m>f'(x_0)~\approx~
2.71281</m>. Approximations can be made by to somewhat straightforward
approximations: the first-order forward difference and the second-order
forward and centered differences. The error in these approximations is
illustrated below, with rounding to simulate calculations by
single-precision and double-precision numbers.

approximations. Line illustrates predicted reduction in error as step
size shrinks. <term>Left:</term> 8 digit calculation (simulated

	<caption>As in Figure <xref ref="fig-diff-step8" />, but
with smaller step sizes included. Note that error <em>increases</em> due
to roundoff for both methods, but especially for the centered method as
the step size is reduced below <m>h = 0.01</m>.</caption>
