idea.</em>

	Though not emphasized here, the techniques that follow
are most useful in higher dimensional integrals. We can integrate
<m>f(x) = x^2</m> using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
<me>\int_0^2 x^2\,dx = \left.\left(\dfrac{x^3}{3}\right)\right|_0^2 =
\dfrac{2^3}{3} - \dfrac{0^3}{3} = \dfrac{8}{3}</me> From the Mean Value
Theorem for Integrals we have that <me>\hat{f} = \dfrac{1}{2-0}\int_0^2
x^2\,dx = \dfrac{1}{2}\cdot \dfrac{8}{3} = \dfrac{4}{3}</me> The shaded
region on the left panel (Fig <xref ref="fig-integration" />) shows the area
under the curve. The area on the right is the same size, but bounded by
a constant function whose value is <m>\hat{f}</m>.

the area under the curve. Right: Average value of a function defined by

	One scheme of Monte Carlo integration uses function
values at randomly chosen points to calculate areas which are then
averaged. Here <me>\int_a^b f(x)\,dx \approx \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}
\underbrace{(b-a)f(x_i)}_\text{\(i\)th area} =
(b-a)\underbrace{\dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} f(x_i)}_\text{average
height}</me> Fig <xref ref="fig-integration-rect" /> (left panel) shows 5 of the
100 random rectangle regions. The shaded area on the right panel
corresponds to the region whose height is the average of the random
function values. Notice that this height very closely compares with the
average value of the function, thus the areas of the regions are
similar.

area and function height by random sampling.</caption>

<p>
	An alternate scheme (Fig <xref ref="fig-integration-mc1" />,
left) plots points in the plane and considers the fraction of points
that fall below the curve (i.e., ‘the acceptance region‘). This fraction
is multiplied by the total area of the region (easier to calculate since
the shape is likely square). Though this is easier to program than the
notation might suggest, consider the indicator function <me>I(i) =
\begin{cases}1, \quad y_i &lt; f(x_i)\\0,
\quad\text{otherwise}\end{cases}</me> and take <me>\int_a^b f(x)\,dx
\approx(f_{max}-f_{min})(b-a)\dfrac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N I(i)</me>
