<div class="para">We read the left-hand side as " <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> composed with <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span>" and the right-hand side as " <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>".  The two sides of the equation have the same mathematical meaning and are equal. The open circle symbol <span class="process-math">\(\circ\)</span> is called the composition operator. We use this operator mainly when we wish to emphasize the relationship between the functions themselves without referring to any particular input value. Composition is a binary operation that takes two functions and forms a new function, much as addition or multiplication takes two numbers and gives a new number. However, it is important not to confuse function composition with multiplication, because in most cases <span class="process-math">\(f(g(x))\neq f(x)g(x)\text{.}\)</span>
